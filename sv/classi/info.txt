Classification is used when the target variable is categorical and you want to assign an item to one of a limited set of classes. The target variable represents discrete categories.


Use classification when:
Categorizing outcomes: When you need to assign inputs to predefined categories, such as spam or not spam.
Identifying groups: When the goal is to identify which category an observation belongs to, such as classifying emails, diagnosing diseases, or recognizing objects in images.
Probability of class membership: When you want to estimate the probability that an instance belongs to each of the classes, such as the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan.



Examples of classification problems:
Classifying emails as spam or not spam.
Diagnosing diseases as benign or malignant.
Identifying handwritten digits.



Classification Algorithms and Use Cases

1. Logistic Regression  (L)
Use Case: Classifying emails as spam or not spam.
Description: A statistical method that models the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables.

2. Support Vector Machines (SVM) (L)
Use Case: Diagnosing diseases based on patient features like age, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.
Description: Finds the hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes with the maximum margin.

3. Decision Tree Classification (N-L)
Use Case: Classifying types of plants based on features like petal length and width.
Description: Splits the data into subsets based on feature values, resulting in a tree where each leaf node represents a class label.

4. Random Forest Classification (N-L)
Use Case: Identifying fraudulent credit card transactions.
Description: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision tree classifiers to improve accuracy and robustness.

5. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) (N-L)
Use Case: Classifying handwritten digits based on pixel values.
Description: Classifies data points based on the majority class among the k-nearest neighbors in the feature space.

6. Naive Bayes (N-L)
Use Case: Sentiment analysis of customer reviews (positive, negative, neutral).
Description: Based on Bayes' theorem, it assumes independence between features and calculates the probability of each class.

7. Neural Networks (Deep Learning)
Use Case: Image recognition tasks, such as identifying objects in photographs.
Description: Deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are highly effective for image and speech recognition tasks.

8. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
Use Case: Predicting customer churn based on user behavior and demographic data.
Description: An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, with each new model correcting errors made by the previous ones.
