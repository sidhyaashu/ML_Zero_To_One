A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification algorithm. It provides a summary of the prediction results on a classification problem, showing the correct and incorrect predictions broken down by each class. This allows for a more detailed analysis than mere accuracy calculation.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the confusion matrix components for a binary classification problem:

True Positive (TP): The number of instances correctly predicted as positive (the model predicted the positive class, and the actual class was also positive).
True Negative (TN): The number of instances correctly predicted as negative (the model predicted the negative class, and the actual class was also negative).
False Positive (FP): The number of instances incorrectly predicted as positive (the model predicted the positive class, but the actual class was negative). Also known as Type I error.
False Negative (FN): The number of instances incorrectly predicted as negative (the model predicted the negative class, but the actual class was positive). Also known as Type II error.



The confusion matrix and derived metrics are crucial for understanding the strengths and weaknesses of a classification model, especially in cases where the class distribution is imbalanced.
